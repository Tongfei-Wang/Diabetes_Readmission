# Diabetes_Readmission

The current project is based on a dataset that contains diabetes patients' clinical data from 1999 to 2008 in 130 US hospitals. The project aims to predict whether or not a diabetes patient will be readmitted to the hospital given various medical data such as medications administered, laboratory tests, and patient attributes. 

The project started with the Exploratory Analysis, Feature Engineering, and Feature Visualizations. The current project applied five machine learning models including the Logistic Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine. After tuning different parameters with cross-validation, the XGBoost model has the best performance with a 0.6325 AUC. Overall, the ensemble methods, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, were good as they reduced variance while providing higher stability.
